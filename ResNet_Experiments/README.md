# DD2424-final-project

## E grade
- Download a pre-trained modern ConvNet such as: ResNet18, ResNet34,...
- Download the dataset Cifar-10
- Solve the multi-class classification problem of recognizing the breed of cat or dog. Explore
each of the following issues when fine-tuning:
  - Benefit of fine-tuning more layers (from just the final layer, and then incrementally
  increasing the number of layers fine-tuned).
  - Different learning rates and/or learning rate schedulers for different layers
  - Benefit of applying data augmentation during training (flip, small rotations, crops,
  small size scaling)
## D-C Grade
- Successfully build a simple Autoencoder using ViT library that works
- Train our primitive model on CIFAR-10, comparing it with pre-trained CovNet
## B-A grade
- Advancing ViT to MAE architecture corresponding to the paperâ€™s implementation
- Experimenting and changing the implemented architecture with the following
  -  Decoder Depth
  - Masked Tokens
  - Masked sampling
  -  Masking ratio
- Establishing a comparison between the results we achieve and the results in the paper
